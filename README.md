# RobomasterVIPSpring2020

This is the repository for the VIP associated with the Purdue Robomaster team to create a self-guided missile system for the International Robomaster Competition in the Spring 2020 semester. The progress for the project will be documented here and the documentation for each subsystem can be found in their respective folder.

## Overview

The Robomaster 2020 competition added a new robot named the "dart". The dart is a self-guided missile system that will travel across the game field and deal damage to the enemy team's base. The team is also responsible for the creation of a dart launcher that will launch the darts. A more in-depth overview can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q_qpdWloxJJ2q0ATfSRlsLZs0-6WAkRAROG2gjLVUHA/edit?usp=sharing). The dart build specification can be found in the [Robomaster Robot Specification Manual](http://rm-static.djicdn.com/documents/13194/b4177a18f71e31577802511685160062.pdf).
