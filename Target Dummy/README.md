## Development Log 
**Week One (1/17 - 1/24)**

I was given the task to create an exact replica of the dart detection module with a working replica of the dart guiding light. [The Robomaster
Competition Rules Manual](http://rm-static.djicdn.com/documents/13194/9f9ee6499b6d81577802626475484930.pdf) listed the specifications for the 
dart guiding light as a 520 nm green LED. 


**Week Two (1/24 - 1/31)**
